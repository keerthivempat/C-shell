C Shell
Overview
This C Shell implementation provides a variety of built-in commands to manage directories, execute programs, handle background processes, and maintain command history. It is designed to offer a streamlined and user-friendly shell experience.

Features and Functionalities
1. Directory Management
Get Current Working Directory: Displays the current directory path in the shell prompt.

Change Directory: Supports changing directories, including handling ~ for the home directory, .. for the parent, and - for the previous directory.

Display Host and Username: The shell prompt shows the current user and system hostname.

2. Command Execution
Sequential and Background Execution: Supports executing multiple commands sequentially and in the background using &.

Custom Command Parsing: Commands are properly tokenized, trimmed, and executed. Whitespace and tabs are handled cleanly.

Command Handler: Built-in commands are detected and executed internally, while unknown commands are passed to the system.

3. Directory Navigation (hop Command)
Navigate through directories with support for:

~ → Home directory

.. → Parent directory

- → Previous directory

4. File and Directory Listing (reveal Command)
Lists files and directories with the following options:

-a → Include hidden files

-l → Show detailed information (permissions, size, etc.)

Outputs are color-coded based on file types.

5. Command History (log Command)
Maintains a log of previously executed commands (up to 15), avoiding consecutive duplicates.

Provides the following options:

View command history.

Clear all history with log purge.

Re-execute a command from history using log execute [n].

6. Background Process Management
Supports running processes in the background with &.

Automatically handles termination of background processes.

Displays completion messages for finished background jobs.

7. Process Information (proclore Command)
Displays detailed information about a process.

Without arguments, shows the current process.

With a PID, shows information about the specified process.

8. File and Directory Search (seek Command)
Allows searching for files and directories with the following options:

-d → Search for directories

-f → Search for files

-e → Execute a file or switch to the found directory

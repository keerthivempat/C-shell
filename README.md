## Features and Functionalities

### 1. 📁 Directory Management

- **Get Current Working Directory**: Displays the current directory path in the shell prompt.
- **Change Directory**: Supports changing directories, including handling `~` for the home directory, `..` for the parent, and `-` for the previous directory.
- **Display Host and Username**: The shell prompt shows the current user and system hostname.

### 2. ⚙️ Command Execution

- **Sequential and Background Execution**: Supports executing multiple commands sequentially and in the background using `&`.
- **Custom Command Parsing**: Commands are properly tokenized, trimmed, and executed. Whitespace and tabs are handled cleanly.
- **Command Handler**: Built-in commands are detected and executed internally, while unknown commands are passed to the system.
